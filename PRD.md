# Product Requirements Document: Claude Code VSCode Extension

**Product Name:** Claude Code Assistant for VSCode  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** May 14, 2025  
**Author:** Claude Team

## Executive Summary

Claude Code Assistant for VSCode is an extension that integrates Anthropic's Claude Code command-line AI coding assistant directly into Visual Studio Code. This extension provides a conversational interface to Claude Code without requiring users to switch between VSCode and a terminal window, creating a seamless development experience with AI assistance.

## Problem Statement

Claude Code is a powerful terminal-based AI coding assistant that helps developers understand codebases, write code, fix bugs, and execute a variety of development tasks through natural language commands. However, the current experience requires users to:

1. Leave their VSCode environment to interact with Claude Code in a separate terminal window
2. Manually copy/paste code snippets between Claude Code and VSCode
3. Frequently context-switch between their editor and terminal
4. Reinitiate the Claude Code process for each new session

These friction points reduce developer productivity and create a disjointed workflow, preventing developers from fully realizing the benefits of AI-assisted coding.

## Product Goals

1. Seamlessly integrate Claude Code into the VSCode environment
2. Eliminate context switching between VSCode and terminal
3. Maintain persistent Claude Code sessions
4. Improve the user experience of interacting with Claude Code
5. Preserve all functionality of the Claude Code CLI
6. Increase developer productivity when using Claude Code

## User Personas

### Primary: Software Developer
- Uses VSCode as their primary IDE
- Wants to leverage AI to assist with coding tasks
- Values workflow efficiency and minimal context switching
- Has varying levels of experience with terminal/CLI tools

### Secondary: Team Lead/Senior Developer
- Manages code quality and mentors other developers
- Uses AI tools to review and improve code
- Wants to streamline workflows across the team
- Values reliable, consistent tooling that integrates with existing processes

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to interact with Claude Code without leaving VSCode, so I can maintain my focus and workflow.
2. As a developer, I want to start a conversation with Claude Code about my current file, so I can get guidance on implementation.
3. As a developer, I want to ask Claude Code to explain a complex piece of code in my project, so I can better understand it.
4. As a developer, I want to ask Claude Code to generate tests for my code, and have them automatically added to my project.
5. As a developer, I want Claude Code to fix bugs across multiple files in my project with a single request.
6. As a developer, I want to continue a previous conversation with Claude Code, so I don't lose context when I reopen VSCode.
7. As a team lead, I want to use Claude Code to review a PR and suggest improvements, without leaving my editor.
8. As a developer, I want to see the changes Claude Code proposes before applying them to my files.

### Technical Constraints

- Compatible with VSCode 1.70.0 and newer
- Support for all platforms where Claude Code is available (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL)
- Claude Code must be installed separately by the user
- Extension must work with user's existing Claude Code authentication
- Low memory and CPU footprint

## User Flows

### First-Time Setup
1. User installs the Claude Code VSCode extension
2. Extension checks for Claude Code installation
   - If not installed, show installation instructions
3. User completes one-time authentication with Anthropic (if needed)
4. Extension shows welcome message with quick start guide

### Starting a Conversation
1. User opens the Claude Code panel from activity bar or command palette
2. Extension starts Claude Code process if not already running
3. User enters a question or task in the input box
4. Claude Code processes the request and displays response
5. User can continue the conversation or perform actions based on response

### Code Modification Flow
1. User asks Claude Code to modify code
2. Claude Code suggests changes
3. Extension shows preview of changes with diff view
4. User reviews changes and clicks "Apply" or "Discard"
5. If applied, changes are made to the file(s)
6. User can undo changes through standard VSCode undo mechanism

### Session Management
