# Product Context: Claude Code VSCode Extension

## Problem Statement
Developers using Anthropic's Claude Code CLI need to switch contexts between their terminal and VSCode, disrupting their coding flow. They need a seamless way to interact with Claude's AI capabilities directly within their IDE.

## User Journey
1. A developer encounters a coding challenge or question while working in VSCode
2. Instead of switching to a terminal, they can directly:
   - Open the Claude Code sidebar
   - Ask a question in the chat interface
   - Highlight code and ask Claude about it
3. Claude responds within VSCode, and the developer can continue coding
4. The conversation history is maintained for context and future reference

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamlessness**: The extension should feel like a natural part of VSCode
- **Contextual Awareness**: Claude should understand the code being discussed
- **Minimal Friction**: Interaction should require minimal keystrokes or clicks
- **Persistence**: Conversations should be preserved between sessions if desired
- **Configurability**: Users should be able to customize the extension behavior

## Value Proposition
- Save time by eliminating context switching
- Improve productivity by keeping answers directly in the development environment
- Enhance code understanding through contextual AI assistance
- Streamline workflow with integrated AI coding companion

## Competitive Landscape
- GitHub Copilot
- Amazon CodeWhisperer
- Other AI coding assistants integrated with VSCode

## Unique Selling Points
- Deep integration with Claude Code's specialized capabilities
- Anthropic's focus on helpful, harmless, and honest AI
- Context preservation between sessions
- Open-source extension architecture

## Future Direction
