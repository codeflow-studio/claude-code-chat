# Task Management Module

This module implements a task management system for complex software development workflows. It can be used independently or integrated with other framework modules.

## Core Purpose

The Task Management module breaks down complex projects into manageable tasks, organizes workflows efficiently, and maintains focus throughout the development process. It excels at:
- Decomposing problems into actionable steps
- Managing dependencies and priorities
- Preventing context overload
- Tracking progress dynamically
- Maintaining focus on current objectives

## Task Management Principles

1. **Task Sizing**: Limit tasks to 2 working hours or 200 lines of code
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each task focuses on one specific objective
3. **Dependency Management**: Track prerequisites between tasks
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Subdivide tasks when they prove too complex
5. **Focused Execution**: Work on one task at a time
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Record decisions and insights

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Understanding
1. Review requirements and documentation
2. Examine project structure
3. Identify objectives and constraints
4. Document assumptions
5. Establish baseline understanding (0-100%)

### Phase 2: Task Decomposition
1. Break down the project into components/features
2. For each component:
   - Identify functionality
   - Map dependencies
   - Estimate complexity
   - Size appropriately (≤2h, ≤200 LOC)
3. Create task breakdown document
4. Update understanding confidence

### Phase 3: Workflow Planning
1. Sequence tasks based on:
   - Dependencies
   - Technical requirements
   - Implementation efficiency
2. Design for minimal context switching
3. Establish validation checkpoints
4. Identify potential bottlenecks
5. Document workflow sequence

### Phase 4: Task Execution
1. Start with highest priority task
2. Define implementation steps and acceptance criteria
3. Complete task with focused attention
4. After completion:
   - Mark as completed
   - Adjust remaining tasks if needed
   - Subdivide upcoming tasks if necessary
5. Select next task based on priorities and dependencies

### Phase 5: Progress Tracking
1. Update task list regularly
2. Reorganize when requirements change
3. Document decisions and insights
4. Maintain focus while considering the big picture

## Task List Format

```markdown
# Project Task List

## Project Overview
Brief description of the project, objectives, and constraints

## Progress Summary
- Started: [Date]
- Current Phase: [Phase Name]
- Completed Tasks: [X/Y]
- Current Focus: [Current Task]

## Task Breakdown

### [Component/Feature 1]
- [ ] Task 1.1: Description
  - Subtask 1.1.1: Description
  - Subtask 1.1.2: Description
- [X] Task 1.2: Description (Completed on [Date])
  - Notes: [Any insights or decisions]

### [Component/Feature 2]
- [ ] Task 2.1: Description (Blocked by: Task 1.1)
- [ ] Task 2.2: Description
  - Priority: High
  - Notes: [Important considerations]

## Next Steps
1. Complete [Current Task]
2. Proceed to [Next Task]
3. Review [Related Component]

## Issues and Considerations
- [Any discovered challenges or questions]
- [Potential risks identified]
```

## Integration with Other Modules

- **Memory Bank**: Task information feeds into activeContext.md and progress.md
- **Developer Profile**: Technical skills inform task complexity estimation
- **TDD Methodology**: Testing tasks are integrated into the task workflow

## Usage Guidelines

### Independent Usage
When used as a standalone module:
- Create and maintain a separate task list document
- Follow the complete five-phase process
- Track all task-related information within the task list

### Integrated Usage
When combined with other modules:
- Coordinate task tracking with Memory Bank updates
- Incorporate TDD cycles into task execution
- Apply Developer Profile skills to task estimation

## Communication Format
When reporting on tasks, structure responses in this order:
1. Current task focus
2. Progress update
3. Challenges or insights
4. Next steps
5. Updated task list (when significant changes occur)

This Task Management module ensures focused, efficient progress on complex software development projects.
