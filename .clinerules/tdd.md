# TDD Methodology Module

This module implements a disciplined Test-Driven Development approach for software engineering. It can be used independently or integrated with other framework modules.

## Core Concept

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. Requirements are turned into specific test cases, then the code is improved to pass the tests. This module ensures code quality, reduces defects, and creates inherently testable systems.

## TDD Core Principles

1. **Tests First**: Write tests before implementation code
2. **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to pass tests
3. **Continuous Testing**: Run all tests after every change
4. **Refactor Safely**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage
5. **Small Increments**: Work in short, testable cycles
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all behaviors, edge cases, and error scenarios

## TDD Development Cycle

### Phase 1: Test Writing (Red)
1. Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Design tests for expected behaviors and edge cases
3. Write automated tests that will initially fail
4. Verify tests fail appropriately
5. Document test coverage expectations
6. **No implementation code during this phase**

### Phase 2: Implementation (Green)
1. Review failing tests to understand requirements
2. Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. Avoid implementing untested functionality
4. Run full test suite after each change
5. Return to implementation if tests fail
6. Proceed only when all tests pass

### Phase 3: Refactoring (Refactor)
1. Review code for quality and maintainability
2. Apply design patterns and best practices
3. Remove duplication and improve clarity
4. Run full test suite after each refactor
5. Revert changes if tests fail
6. Proceed only when all tests pass

### Phase 4: Cycle Completion
1. Verify all requirements are satisfied
2. Confirm all tests pass
3. Update documentation
4. Plan the next increment
5. Repeat the TDD cycle

## Quality Metrics

Track and report the following metrics for each TDD cycle:
- Test Coverage: Percentage of code covered by tests
- Defect Rate: Number of defects per unit of code
- Cycle Time: Duration of each TDD cycle
- Maintainability Index: Code quality and readability measure
- Regression Rate: Number of previously working features broken

## Integration with Other Modules

- **Task Management**: TDD cycles integrated into task workflow
- **Memory Bank**: Test strategies and metrics documented in memory files
- **Developer Profile**: Testing expertise applied to implementation

## Usage Guidelines

### Independent Usage
When used as a standalone module:
- Follow the complete TDD cycle for all development
- Track metrics independently
- Maintain strict discipline in the test-first approach

### Integrated Usage
When combined with other modules:
- Incorporate TDD cycles into Task Management workflow
- Document test strategies in Memory Bank
- Apply testing expertise from Developer Profile
- Ensure all tasks include appropriate test cases

## Enforcement Protocol

To maintain TDD discipline:
1. Verify failing tests exist before writing implementation code
2. Confirm all tests pass before proceeding to next phase
3. Run the full test suite after every code change
4. When tests fail, immediately return to previous phase
5. Request assistance if unable to resolve test failures

This TDD Methodology module ensures high-quality, well-tested code that meets requirements and resists regressions.
