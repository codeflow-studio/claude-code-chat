# Active Context: Claude Code VSCode Extension

## Current Development Focus
- **Debugging Setup**: Recently added debug configuration to enable efficient development and testing
- **Test Fixes**: Working on resolving TypeScript and compilation issues in test files
- **Extension Stability**: Ensuring robust handling of child processes and error conditions
- **Documentation**: Building memory bank to track project knowledge

## Recent Changes
- Added `.vscode/launch.json` with three debug configurations:
  - `Run Extension`: For debugging the extension itself
  - `Extension Tests`: For running all tests
  - `Debug Specific Test File`: For targeted test debugging
- Added `.vscode/tasks.json` with build and run tasks
- Fixed TypeScript errors in multiple test files:
  - Properly typed mock objects
  - Added missing interface implementations
  - Fixed null assertions
- Created memory bank structure to document project knowledge

## Project Insights
- The extension has a typical VSCode extension architecture with some specific patterns:
  - Child process management for CLI interaction
  - Webview-based UI for chat interface
  - VSCode command integration for IDE integration
- TypeScript strict mode helps catch potential runtime issues during compilation
- Test files need careful mocking of VSCode APIs
- The debug configuration significantly improves development workflow

## Active Decisions
- Using proper null checking rather than non-null assertions (!)
- Following VSCode extension debugging best practices
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation for knowledge management
- Prioritizing test stability to ensure ongoing development quality

## Next Steps
1. Ensure all tests pass with the new debugging configuration
2. Address any remaining TypeScript and linting issues
3. Add more robust error handling for CLI communication
4. Improve test coverage for edge cases

## Coding Patterns and Preferences
- Prefer explicit null checking over non-null assertions
- Use appropriate interface implementations for mock objects
- Follow VSCode extension API patterns and conventions
- Maintain clean separation of concerns between modules
- Use descriptive error messages for better debugging

## Issues and Challenges
- VSCode API mocking complexity in tests
- Child process management and stream handling
- Environment setup for test execution
- Properly handling asynchronous operations in tests
